Persons playing on these courts must recognise the inherent risks they are taking. Any accident involving personal injury or any incident involving personal loss, however caused, will not be the responsibility of the Tsawwassen Tennis Club, its Executive Committee or its Members. Members are reminded to lock automobiles and secure personal effects such as wallets and purses while on court.</div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><h3>Booking Board</h3>The Sign-up Board beside the clubhouse door strictly controls court use. Chalk is available beneath the Board and in the clubhouse under the phone. If players want to ensure they get court time, they MUST enter their names and their start times on this Board. A minimum of 2 players must be present for the sign-up. Proper use of the Booking Board ensures that everyone gets their share of playing times when the courts are busy. When previous players&#39; court time is up, write the current time on the Board, and then wait outside your selected court for completion of their last point. A court may be re-booked immediately only if others are not waiting. Maximum playing times when others are waiting: 45 minutes for singles, and 60 minutes for doubles. <b>PLAYERS NOT SIGNING UP ON THE BOARD RISK BEING 'BUMPED' FROM PLAY WHEN THE COURTS ARE BUSY.</b></div><div class="clearfix visible-lg-block"></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><h3>Guests</h3>Guests are permitted 3 playing visits. Please sign your guest(s) in - there is a blue binder labeled 'Guest Book' on the table beside the sliding door. Once a guest has played 3 times then that guest should be invited to join the Club as he / she has used up maximum guest privileges.</div><div class="clearfix visible-lg-block"></div></div>
